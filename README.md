Guess the number game!

I decided to make this project on Android Studio as that is the application Iâ€™m most comfortable with. I started by editing activity_main.xml. I added 2 textviews, a button and an edittext field. The edittext field is where the user would add the number they want to guess and then they would click on the guess button. Based on their guess, the program would tell them if the required number is lower or higher than their guess. This process would continue until the required number is guessed correctly.
